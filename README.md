# Piksel Kapcio
This is a **PHP** captcha-like library.
## What is it?
Are you tired of users complaining that this obscure captcha you use on your website is sooo annonying and hard to solve? Are you bored with all bots being defeated by the captcha you use? Well, we have good news for you! **Piksel Kapcio** is now available! It's a captcha library, but not really! It's really easy to read, both for human and bots! 
## Disclaimer
Use at your own risk!
This was never meant to be a hard to solve captcha. I never tried it against bots, so I can only assume it's not really good. This was created more as an easy to configure, easy to use, easy to solve thing, with specific esthetics applied, that would throttle human users a bit.
## Installation
Easy peasy, just use composer:
```bash
composer require wymarzonylogin/piksel-kapcio
```
